I am a trained Public Health Researcher, Research Data Management Expert and Biostatistician; and presently employed as the Research Officer and Data Analyst (Scientist) for the Centre for Health and Development (CHD), University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria, a Centre that evolved from over 10 years of collaboration between faculty members from the University of Port Harcourt  and the University of Toronto, Canada.  The aim of the CHD is to develop human and organizational capacity for health-related research and quality health care provision in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, built on sustainable local structure, and international collaborations.
